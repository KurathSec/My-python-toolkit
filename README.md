# My Python Automation Toolkit

A collection of practical Python scripts for automation, data analysis, and cybersecurity exploration.

## 1. About This Repository

This repository is a live collection of the utility scripts and tools I write during my self-study and project work.

My primary focus is on using Python as a practical tool to solve problems, automate repetitive tasks, and explore concepts in network security and data analysis. This toolkit will grow as I continue to learn and build new things.

## 2. Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Core Libraries:** (As this grows, I will add libraries like `pandas`, `requests`, `boto3`, `scapy`, etc.)

## 3. How to Use This Repository

Each script or small project is contained within its own directory (e.g., `/Log-Analysis/`, `/File-Management/`).

**Note on Documentation:**
Most scripts in this collection are "one-off" utilities. To maintain efficiency, the purpose, usage, and context for each script are documented **directly in the comments at the top of the `.py` file itself**, rather than in separate `README.md` files.

## 4. Current Script Categories

As this toolkit expands, scripts are organized into the following areas:

* **/Automation/**: Scripts for automating daily tasks (e.g., file organization, web scraping, API interaction).
* **/Security-Analysis/**: Tools for parsing logs, analyzing network data, or practicing cybersecurity concepts (e.g., CTF tools).
* **/Data-Tools/**: Utilities for cleaning, processing, or analyzing data sets.
* **/Misc-Utilities/**: Other useful, single-purpose scripts.

## 5. About Me

I am a self-directed learner passionate about building a career in network security and systems analysis. I believe in using code to create efficient and secure solutions.
